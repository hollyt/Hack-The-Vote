# Hack The Vote

Hack the Vote is a webapp designed and built for the Lehman College NSBE Hackathon 2014 to address the prompt 'Create an app to help facilitate social change'.   

The midterm elections had just passed with a very small voter turnout for young adults. We decided to create a game that allows users to connect with their friends on Twitter and share high scores, hopefully bringing them to our web page with information on how to be a more informed voter.   

**We won first place!** Check out a live demo [here]().
